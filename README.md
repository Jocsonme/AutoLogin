# AutoLogin

This library implements a Symfony2 security firewall listener to authenticate
users based on a single query parameter. This is useful for providing one-click
login functionality in email and newsletter links.

## Compatibility

This bundle's `master` branch maintains compatibility with Symfony2's master
branch. The 1.0.x tag for this bundle tracks its `master` branch.

There is no support for Symfony 2.0.x.
